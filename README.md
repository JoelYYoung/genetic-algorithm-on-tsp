# genetic-algorithm-on-tsp

In this project, we apply *genetic algorithm*(GA) on TSP. We designed different stretagies of *crossover* and *variation*, and compared their performance.

## Crossover

According to the real process of revoltion in which chromosomes exchange genes embeded in protein segments, we should ensure the following features of crossover:

- Genes should remain relatively complete.

## Variation

## Result
